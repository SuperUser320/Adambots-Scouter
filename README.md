Adambot Scouter
================

This software is designed to be used to facilitate the collection and representation of scouting data from <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> events.

Some useful features of the software are/will be:
   * The ability to load and save to local storage for consistent storage in areas with spotty WiFi connections
   * Synchronizes with a server so data can be accessed by anywhere by anyone
   * Collects match data from FIRST match servers and easily formats and integrates into spreadsheets

The source for this project is freely available for anyone to use, in fact we encourage you to fork our project and use it to create even bigger and better things!
